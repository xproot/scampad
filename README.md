## Features
dont trust these percentages idk how it really works tbh
- ~10% chance of fake crash on startup
- ~1.2% chance of hanging for 1-15s while use
- ~10% chance of deleting selection
- ~0.4% chance of changing all "scan" to "scam"
- ~0.8% chance of Changing the font to one of these
> "Webdings", "Comic Sans MS", "Impact", "Segoe Script", "Symbol"
- ~0.4% chance of inserting one of these strings
> " this is not easy", "wbasbd", " what happened?", " please give me your creditcard info sir",
  " this costs $1400 per month", " not", " please no", " do not do it", " go to your bank", "this is not important"
- ~9.5% chance of opening bing with the selected text

along with everything from notepad
**EXCEPT:**
- Printing (window shows up but i didnt implement printing)
- Find (too lazy to figure out how to implement that)
- Text file drag and drop (no idea how to, normal text dragged from another text box works.)
- Go To and Line & Column are broken on Word Wrap, GoTo has a patch that just disables word wrap for a second and Line & Column doesn't care
- Go To is also kinda broken 
- Anything I forgot

## Build instructions
honestly i usually make good readmes but i honestly dont know how this works you just get visual studio and run the sln i guess?
